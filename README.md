# Introduction
The application has been developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **SASS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **npm** and **git**. It has been tested with **Cypress** (E2E and Component testing types) and documented with **JSDoc** (for developers) and **MS Word** (for users). Available on desktop and mobile devices with responsive design.
The purpose of the project is to fetch data from an open API to get weather info for users about any city across the globe.
# Algorithm
Users type any city and click on the button to get weather data. The application trims unnecessary spaces. If a user request is empty, an error asking to provide a city pops up in the weather card. Otherwise the application makes a request to the open weather API. Based on response, the result will be shown for users (either an error or weather data in a city).
